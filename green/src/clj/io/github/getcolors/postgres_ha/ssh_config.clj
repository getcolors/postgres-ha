  "The deployment's `~/.ssh/config` block, per the workspace SSH Config Standard.

  The block itself is written by the `ansible-local` stage, because that is the
  one place the address is known and because `blockinfile` already handles the
  idempotent replace. What lives here is everything that must happen before the
  stage renders: the alias, the identity file, and the refusal to adopt a
  stanza this package did not write.

  Unlike the keypair, this play is the package's own copy rather than ONCE's
  (standard §7). The file is shared with every other host the operator reaches,
  so an unrelated change upstream must not be able to rewrite it at pin-bump
  time. The alias list, though, is the Compute Cluster Standard's (§6) and
  comes from ONCE."
